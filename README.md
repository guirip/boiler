# Nawr Example

This is a minimal example using [nawr](https://github.com/hobochild/nawr).

## Getting Started

Then run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tests

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
